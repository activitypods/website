					Solid (Social Linked Data) is a set of specifications whose aim is to allow users to store all their data in Pods ("Personal Online Datastores"). Users have full control over their Pods and can give permissions to applications or people they trust.

					What is the main shortcoming of Solid Pods ?
				</p>
				<p class="text-white text-lg">
					Despite its name, Solid includes few features for social networking. For example, when you share a resource, the recipient will not know about it, unless you write to him. In their current implementation, Pods are personal databases with little connection to the outside world.

					How does ActivityPods solve this shortcoming ?
				</p>
				<p class="text-white text-lg">
					With ActivityPods, all Pods are able to easily communicate with other Pods, thanks to the ActivityPub outbox and inbox. When you add a contact to your Pod, for example, he can be automatically be notified and add you back.
